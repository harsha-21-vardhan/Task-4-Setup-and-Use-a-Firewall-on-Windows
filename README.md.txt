#  Task 4 - Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

# Objective: Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic.

# Tools: Windows Firewall (wf.msc)

## Steps Performed

   1. Opened firewall configuration tool
   2. Created inbound rule to block TCP port 23 (Telnet)
   3. Verified the block with Telnet client
   4. Deleted the rule after testing

## Why Port 23?
   Port 23 is used by Telnet, which is insecure and should    be blocked.
